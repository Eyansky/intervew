## Palindromes
A palindrome is a word or phrase that is spelt the same way forward and backward (disregarding whitespace, punctuation and capitalization). Examples include madam, level, nurses run.

## Task 
Create a simple program that identifies palindromes. At a minimum, it should take in a word/phrase from the user via an input, determine whether or not it is a palindrome, and display the result. It should also keep a record of the last 5 entries made by the user.

Include tests for this program.

## Switch Reverser
A common operation is needing to swap the order of items in a collection of data

## Task
Create a program that will:
 reverse the order of a list if the list consists of integers alone,
Will convert the list items to uppercase if the list contains words only.
Will return the same list if the list members donâ€™t satisfy either of these two criteria

Include tests for this program.
